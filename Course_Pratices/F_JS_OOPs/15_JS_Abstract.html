    <!-- 
The given code is an example of creating an abstract class in JavaScript using constructor functions and prototypes.

In JavaScript, there is no built-in support for abstract classes. 
However, developers can create a similar concept by using certain techniques or conventions. 
In this code, the `Vehicle` function is intended to serve as an abstract class.

Inside the `Vehicle` constructor function, 
there is a line `throw new Error("You cannot create an instance of Abstract class");`. 
This line throws an error with a custom message whenever an attempt is made to create an instance 
of the `Vehicle` class. The intention here is to prevent direct instantiation of the abstract class.

The `Vehicle.prototype.display` method is defined using the prototype. 
It is a method that can be shared among instances of `Vehicle` or its derived classes. 
In this case, the `display` method returns the `vehicleName` property of the object.

Finally, an instance of `Vehicle` is created using the `new` keyword: `var vehicle = new Vehicle();`. 
Since the constructor throws an error, attempting to create an instance of the abstract class will result in an error being thrown.

In summary, the given code demonstrates an attempt to create an abstract 
class in JavaScript by throwing an error in the constructor when an instance is created. 
This approach aims to enforce the concept of an abstract class where instances cannot be created directly, 
but derived classes can extend and implement their own versions of the abstract class.
