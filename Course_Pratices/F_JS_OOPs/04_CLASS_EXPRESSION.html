<!-- 

     This HTML file contains a simple JavaScript script within the <script> tags. Let me break it down for you:

DOCTYPE and HTML Structure:

<!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the document type and version of HTML used.
<html lang="en">: The opening tag for an HTML document with the specified language.
Head Section:

<head>: Contains metadata such as character encoding, viewport settings, and the document title.
<meta charset="UTF-8">: Defines the character encoding for the document as UTF-8.
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">: Provides directives to the browser on how to render the content.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: Sets the viewport for responsive web design.
<title>javascript class</title>: Sets the title of the HTML document displayed on the browser tab.
Body Section:

<body>: Contains the visible content of the web page.
JavaScript Section:

<script>: The opening tag for embedding JavaScript code.
var emp = class { ... }: Defines a JavaScript class named emp using the class syntax. This class has a constructor method that initializes id with the value 23 and name with the string "Jenney".
document.writeln("Hello " + emp.name): Attempts to write "Hello " followed by the name property of the emp class onto the document. However, this won't work as intended because emp here is a class, not an instance of the class. To access properties like name, you need to create an instance of the class first.
The output would likely be "Hello undefined" since emp.name is being accessed directly from the class definition, not an instance of the class.

The comment in your code seems to be asking why a specific output is appearing, which is likely due to attempting to access emp.name directly without instantiating the class first.
