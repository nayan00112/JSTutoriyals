In JavaScript, you can use the `import` and `export` statements to work with modules, allowing you to organize your code into separate files or modules and use their functionalities in other parts of your codebase.

Here's a basic example of how you can use `export` and `import`:

### Exporting:
```javascript
// math.js (module file)
export const add = (a, b) => a + b;
export const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;
```

### Importing:
```javascript
// main.js
import { add, subtract } from './math.js';

console.log(add(5, 3)); // Outputs: 8
console.log(subtract(8, 3)); // Outputs: 5
```

- The `export` statement is used to export functions, variables, or objects from a module.
- The `import` statement is used to import functionalities exported by other modules into the current module.

Note:
- When using `import` and `export`, the files need to be served via a server due to CORS restrictions in most modern browsers when using the `file://` protocol. This means you might need a basic server setup to test these functionalities.
- Additionally, the usage of `import` and `export` might slightly differ depending on the environment you are using (Node.js, modern browser with ES6 support, etc.). For example, Node.js uses `require` and `module.exports` for module handling.





In JavaScript, specifically in Node.js, `require` is a keyword used to import modules or files. It's the counterpart to the `import` statement used in modern JavaScript for browsers. `require` is particularly prevalent in Node.js for loading modules, libraries, or other files in a CommonJS module system.

Here's an example of how `require` is used in Node.js:

```javascript
// Loading a built-in Node.js module
const fs = require('fs');

// Loading a custom module or file
const mathFunctions = require('./mathFunctions');
```

In this example:
- `require('fs')` imports the built-in Node.js 'fs' module, used for file system operations.
- `require('./mathFunctions')` imports a custom module or file named 'mathFunctions' from the local directory.

The exported functionalities from the required file or module can be accessed using the object or variable it's assigned to via `require`. For instance, if `mathFunctions.js` exports functions using `module.exports`:

```javascript
// mathFunctions.js
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

function subtract(a, b) {
    return a - b;
}

module.exports = {
    add,
    subtract
};
```

You can then use these functions in your main file:

```javascript
// main.js
const mathFunctions = require('./mathFunctions');

console.log(mathFunctions.add(5, 3)); // Outputs: 8
console.log(mathFunctions.subtract(8, 3)); // Outputs: 5
```

`require` is synchronous and the modules are cached once they are loaded, meaning that calling `require` multiple times for the same module will return the same instance without re-executing the module's code.

It's important to note that in modern JavaScript environments (like modern browsers with ES6 modules), the `import` statement is preferred for importing modules. However, in Node.js or environments that support CommonJS modules, `require` is still widely used.
